    Scenario Outline: Reject invalid Immigration claims
        Given user is on their submission details page
        When user adds an outcome for Immigration with "<case id>", "<mt>", "<ecs code>", "<ecf ref>", "<case start date>", "<pa>" and "<ap>"
        Then the outcome does not save and the error message "<error message>" appears
        Examples:
            | case id | mt        | ecs code | ecf ref   | case start date | pa      | ap      | error message                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
